        <h1>The first ever video game was created in 1958</h1>

        <p>The very first video game was called "Tennis for Two" and was created in 1958 by physicist William Higinbotham. It was a simple two-player game that simulated a tennis match using an oscilloscope, which was a type of electronic instrument used for displaying and analyzing waveforms. Players used knobs to control the position of their paddles on the screen and hit a dot (representing a ball) back and forth over a virtual net. While it was a simple game, it was groundbreaking in that it demonstrated the potential of electronic games and paved the way for the development of the video game industry as you know it today.</p>
